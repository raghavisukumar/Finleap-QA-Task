## Test cases

I have written my test cases in [TestLink](https://wiki.openoffice.org/w/images/1/1b/Testlink_user_manual.pdf). TestLink is a web-based test management system that facilitates software quality assurance. The platform offers support for test cases, test suites, test plans, test projects and user management, as well as various reports and statistics. 

I have presented the test case report "Finleap-Signin-Signup-Testcases.pdf" generated from TestLink.
